            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit to my ſingular comfort (Chriſtian Reader) I might in the Sunne-ſhine of mine owne happineſſe haue enioyed to my ſelfe the great benefite of Gods fauour ſhewed mee in my conuerſion from Romiſh nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the ancient Catholike Faith, taught in this Kingdome; yet for that I had diuers reaſons inuiting mee to the participation thereof vnto other mens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that what was priuate to my ſelfe, might be alſo a publique good vnto others; I haue thought it expedient with the promulgation of it, for thy better information concerning my ſelfe, to propound vnto thee ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aduertiſements, whereby thou mayeſt the better know mee and my meaning, who am otherwiſe perhappes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto thee; and accordingly with moderation of iudgement, void of impatient humour or partialitie, cenſure my proceedings, in the matters handled in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Firſt therefore, I would haue thee take notice, that ſome few, more zealous and earneſt than charitable or wiſe followers of the Church of Rome, ſticke not to obiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, That they cannot be perſwaded, that I am truly in iudgement &amp; vnderſtanding a ſincere Profeſſor of the faith of England, otherwiſe than for ſome priuate reſpect, eyther of liberty, or other contentment or preferment; whereby you may well inferre, that they haue no great opinion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorance in me of their Doctrine, nor of actual miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb facs="tcp:25258:4"/>in maners that ſhould make me forſake their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſince they thinke I haue too much knowledge to be in heart of any other, and yet can charge mee of no miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour; for mine owne part, I muſt needes tell you, that herein they are either very ignorant in their vnderſtandings, or malitiouſly affected in their willes; ignorant of the true knowledge of Gods fauour in conuerting ſinners, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious to the Church of England, whereunto I haue incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated my ſelfe; and therefore to diſgrace it, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, without either true vnderſtanding or vertue, to caſt any ſiniſter imputation they can vpon my perſon; which I doubt not but by Gods aſſiſtance and the endeuors of patience &amp; and diligence; I ſhall turne to their owne ſhame, and to the further manifeſtation of the wicked doctrines and impieties of their Romiſh Church; without any indignitie or diſgrace to the Church to which I am now incorporated.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Secondly, I would further haue thee know, that ſome few Prieſts of their Church, hauing growne debauched in their liues and conuerſations, and after their forſaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of Rome for a cloake of liberty to their lewd inclinations, haue proued moſt treacherous to thoſe vnto whom before they profeſſed friendſhip, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their owne conſciences perſwaded they did not well in diſcouering Prieſts, and cauſing them to be apprehended and ranſacking the houſes of Recuſants, more for their own profits, than for any deſire of ſeruice to the ſtate, or zeale to the Church of England; giuing ouer all exerciſe both of vertue or learning, fit for Cleargy men. Hereupon diuers of the Romaine Church haue made their aduantage for the iuſtification of their owne Religion, and reproofe of theyr aduerſaries faith; inſomuch that I heard a Ieſuit of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſay, that a great noble man of this realme being in conference with others of his rancke ſhould ſay, that he much wondred why ſuch men as were vertuous in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſo long as they were of the Church of Rome, when they came to the Church of England they prooued diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb facs="tcp:25258:5"/>of life, &amp; moſt licentious in their conuerſations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſuch as went from the Church of England to the church of Rome, though they were neuer ſo diſorderly before, they afterward were reformed in their conuerſations, and moſt religiouſly exemplar in their behauiours. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſhew that this obſeruation proueth not alwayes ſo, and that thoſe of the Engliſh Church might not bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with this illuſion of the Diuell, you may from me take notice, that it hath pleaſed almighty God heretofore to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert diuerſe who haue liued with good fame in the Church of England, and of late one maſter <hi>Richard Sheldon,</hi> whoſe both learning &amp; vertuous conuerſation, euen in the Church of Rome, hath beene ſuch as is vnimpeachable by any of his Aduerſaries, as farre forth as euer I could heare, and ſo ſtill manifeſteth as much in religious zeale to the Church of England; and for mine owne part, I can boldly ſay, that I find as good curbes by the Doctrine of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to keepe men from ſinne, as in the Church of Rome; by vertue whereof, I doubt not, but with Gods aſſiſtance I ſhall liue to ſerue him in this Church with leſſe ſinne than euer I could haue done in the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Thirdly, I muſt giue you further notice, that it is a thing wel knowne, that there are in this realme many diſſembling Proteſtants, which outwardly doe all the acts of Religion belonging to this Church of England, either to ſtay in their places in the common-wealth, or to anoyde their penall lawes; and yet in their hearts are reſolued beleeuers of the Roman Faith, egregiouſly diſſembling both with God and men, and practiſing moſt notorious equiuocation, aſwell in matters of faith as manners; who will not ſticke to take oathes, receiue Sacraments, go to Church, and commit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a like act directly againſt their conſciences &amp; perſwaſion, which according to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is ſinne;<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>14.</hi> verſ. <hi>23</hi>
               </note> nay, I dare affirme that it is a hainous mortall ſinne, approaching neare to that ſinne againſt which Chriſt himſelfe pronounceth a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous threatning ful of terror to any conſiderat heart, ſaying;
<pb facs="tcp:25258:5"/>
               <hi>That he that ſinneth against the holy Ghoſt, ſhall neuer be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. <hi>12.</hi> verſ. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> Whence it may appeare, that ſuch men, as they are moſt treacherous to God, ſo may it be probably thought they cannot be loyall vnto men; and therefore are they to bee held the moſt dangerous men that can be in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, preferring the glorie of men before the glorie of God: which being a thing much practiſed by ſome affected to the Church of Rome, I haue beene the more willing, both for their better information, to publiſh theſe my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, as alſo to giue ſatisfaction to the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land concerning my ſelfe, who am (I thanke God) moſt free from ſo hatefull a crime, odious both to God and man.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fourthly, I am further to let you vnderſtand, that my intention in theſe my Obſeruations, being more for the inſtruction of the Profeſſors of the Church of Rome, than for thoſe of the Church of England (who ſtand in no neede of ſo meane a ſcholler as my ſelfe) I haue cited often the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that Church euen againſt themſelues, thinking no way better to confute their Doctrines, than by their owne grounds and their owne Teachers. And although I handle not all points controuerſed betwixt Rome and the reformed Churches at this day; yet doe I ſo entreat of the chiefeſt points of Practiſe and Doctrine, that all thoſe being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to be but erronious and nouell, and ſuch as cannot ſtand with the true grounds of Chriſtianitie, I thinke there is no man of ſound iudgement can thinke I had iuſt cauſe to ſtay any longer in that Church, or that themſelues can be partakers of Saluation, remaining in the ſame.</p>

Here it may be well conſidered, how much my ſoule, partly ſolicited by the loue of truth, and ſtrongly yet held faſt in the traiterous affection of fleſh and bloud, was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled in this conflict againſt two aduerſe powers; the one inuiting me to heauen, the other weighing me downe vnto earth; the one ſhewing me the way to God, the other hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me from him by the heauineſſe of naturall affection. Sixtly,<note place="margin">Externall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let.</note> the reputation and good opinion I found that both the Romiſh Clergie and Laitie had of me, might well haue ouerſwayed any man that was not a maſter ouer ſelfe-loue, and a contemner of vaineglorie.

Seuenthly,<note place="margin">Naturall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let.</note> I was armed further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this my conuerſion, by an extraordinarie heauineſſe I apprehended it would breede to thoſe whom I had in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times reconciled to the Church of Rome, thinking they would rather grieue for me as one lapſed, than follow mee as one riſen; vnleſſe it ſhould pleaſe God by his eſpeciall grace to giue them the like occaſions to finde out the truth,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25258:12"/>as out of his fatherly prouidence he gaue vnto me.</p>
               <p>Oh what inward conflicts,<note place="margin">The conflicts going before my conuerſion</note> almoſt inſufferable, did theſe conſiderations breede in my very ſoule, ſo long habituated in the Romane faith, and practiſed in that Religion? How often did they ſtop me in my way to Chriſt, and from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation to his true Church? How was my poore ſoule here enuironed with perplexed aſſaults of fleſh and bloud? of ſelfe-loue? of naturall affection to my friends? and as I conceiued then, of ſupernaturall affection and zeale to my ghoſtly children? Ah how manie powerfull arguments of humane wiſedome did wraſtle againſt my poore vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and againſt the light of grace, Gods inſpirations often illuſtrating my ſoule with the beames of his heauenly truth, which I ſet too lightly of, as of temptations, the reſiſtance whereof I then thought was meritorious, howſoeuer I ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in my conuerſation outwardly to ſhadow them, faining a counterfeit quietneſſe and calmeneſſe of mind, when I was moſt violently toſſed and troubled in mine owne conſcience? The nights could not affoord me ordinarie reſt and repoſe, but often when I thought to ouercome theſe conflicts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt falſehood and truth, by taking my vſuall reſt; euen in my ſleepe I ſhould find ſuddaine daies of grace and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all light to awaken me, and to enforce me to take delight in the Sunne-ſhine of truth; which as I had not grace then to conceiue as I ſhould, I held to be but illuſorie flaſhes of the Angell of darkneſſe, transforming himſelfe into the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and likeneſſe of the Angell of light, to deceiue my ſoule withall, and ſo I confeſſed them, as ordinarie temptations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith, till at length with a more powerfull light it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the true Sonne of iuſtice and God of glorie to enlighten my vnderſtanding, in ſuch ſort, that all the clouds of error and endarkened affections were diſperſed like miſt before the Sunne; what before I held to be hereticall, I approued to be moſt Catholike; what before was falſehood, was now truth; what before was darkneſſe, was now light. I found my ſelfe ſuddainely in my meditations vpon the grounds of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25258:12"/>true faith and beleefe, like S. <hi>Paul,</hi> enuironed, not with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, but with a ſpirituall and moſt comfortable light from heauen, placing my vnderſtanding in the paradiſe of truth and all her delights, ſtruck downe to the ground in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgement of mine vnworthineſſe, and terrified with a voice from heauen, not ſounding in the eares of my bodie by their corporall Organs, but ſweetly making a moſt delightfull harmonie in my ſoule, mollifying the obdurate cruſt of my heart, and forcing me to ſay,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>9.</hi> verſ. <hi>6.</hi>

Hence was I moued with great power, working euen with comfort to my ſoule, to call to mind innumerable paſſages of Scriptures and auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in former times obſerued, and other reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruencies, moouing me moſt effectually to conuert my ſelfe to the onely Apoſtolike, Primitiue, and Catholike faith, truly profeſſed in the Church of England, as it were deſtined here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by a preſage in my youth, when being borne beyond the ſeas, I was by Gods directing prouidence, inſpiring my parents mindes by my nurſe and her husband (who were purpoſely ſent for out of England) ſent into this Realme, when I was but few daies old, to be nurſed here; which was a great furtherance and meanes that now in the ninth yeare of my Prieſthood I am in this Realme nurſed and growne to ſuch a ſpirituall ſtrength, as to embrace the right faith of a true Chriſtian, which heretofore I wanted.

How after many ſickneſſes in Rome where I continued three yeares, I was made Prieſt, intending no other end then to employ my whole life and labours in connerting ſoules to the Church or Rome, which I was conſtantly perſwaded then was the true Church of God; and therfore I thought I could take no courſe of life vpon me more gratefull to God, more profitable to others, or more meritorious for mine own ſoule then this was: thus diſpoſed and reſolued, how I with my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes kiſſing the Powes feete, and receiuing his benediction vpon our ſelues, and vpon our beads, croſſes and meddalles, with power to giue the Engliſh pardon to others here, for

How ſince I haue ſpent my time for the moſt part heere in England about nine yeares in the practiſe of this function. Where my labours in that kinde were not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, nor ill eſteemed of by thoſe of the Romane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, in the which no danger of lawes affrighted me, no impriſonments made me ſaint, no croſſes quailed my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Now when I reflect vpon all theſe occurrences of my life with diuers others, I cannot but magnifie the wiſedome of Almightie God, and highly exalt his diuine prouidence: and therefore the nearer that I approach vnto the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the occaſions and motiues which God hath vſed to worke my conuerſion in this Realme to the true ancient A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike and Catholike faith, giuing me knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many nouelties and erroneous doctrines diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly oppoſite to the doctrines of Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and the ancient Catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Since my comming into this Realme Prieſt,<note place="margin">Reading of Proteſtant bookes the firſt occaſion of doubts.</note> I obſerued no one thing to be more neceſſarie for the ende I aymed at then the ſtudie of controuerſies, whereunto next vnto the Scriptures for exhortation, and caſes of conſcience, for the better directing of ſoules, I chiefely applied my ſelfe, in the ſtudie whereof I found it behooueful, nt to neglect the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſuch Proteſtant writers as fell into my hands, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king I ſhould thereby be the better able to confute all obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions when occaſion of conference with any ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which thing being yearely prohibited by the cenſure of <hi>Bulla coenae,</hi> which is once euerie yeare with many execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and curſes publiſhed in Rome, I obtained leaue of my Superior to read them with condition not to ſtudy them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maſter</hi> George Blackwell.</note> but to confute them: which diſtinction ſeemed ſtrange vnto me as though I could confute them, and not ſtudy them; yet with this condition I promiſed to read them; amongſt which the firſt that came into my hand was Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> reformed Catholike deliuered me by a kinſman of mine, who told me
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25258:17"/>of a Couſen of his that promiſed to be a Romane Catholike if he could ſee that booke well anſwered and confuted. Next to this I met with Maſter <hi>Robert Abbots</hi> booke in Latine of Anti-Chriſt giuen to a friend of mine by a worſhipfull Knight of this Realme, who highly praiſed it, and much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed thereof. After that I lighted vpon Maſter Doctor <hi>Bucklies</hi> confutation of Maſter <hi>Thomas Wrightes</hi> articles. After that I met with the booke of proceedings againſt the Pouder-Traytors, containing in it that moſt eloquent and learned Oration of the Earle of North-hampton. Then came to my hands his Maieſties Apologie for the oath of Allegiance, with his premonition to Chriſtian Princes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this I fell by a meere chance vpon the booke of the now Lord of Canterburies written in confutation of ſome of Maſter Doctor <hi>Hilles</hi> quarterne of reaſons. Next met I with the Biſhop of Lincolnes anſwere to <hi>Parſons</hi> with ſome others. All which I peruſed diligently, and with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in which writings although ſome doctrinall points much diſtaſted my palate by reaſon of my ſetled affection to the Romane faith, yet I found many points both doctrinall and morall, verie remarkable and powerfull to moue ſtrong doubtes, had I not by the implicite faith of whatſoeuer the Romane Church teacheth, folued them all, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently held them as matters of ſcandall and temptation: the firſt of which ought not to moue a ſetled conſtancie, nor the ſecond to finde any entertainment, but euen at the verie firſt occurrence to be reiected; yet notwithſtanding at the laſt, reflecting vpon many former obſeruations, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that ground of implicite faith to be ſubiect to the daunger of errour, and held it fit to examine verie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the groundes of the true Church, eſpecially for a Cleargie-man, who is to yeelde a reaſon of his faith, and to giue ſatisfaction vnto others; and chiefely in ſuch times as the queſtion is to be diſcuſſed which is the true Church, a man ought to heare, to beleeue, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if hee will not be eſteemed as a Heathen and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25258:17"/>Then began I to reflect more ſeriouſly vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer points, and to grow very familiar with the aforeſaid bookes, and with much ſtay to examine the reaſons and ſolutions of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to his aduerſaries, in the chiefeſt points of Doctrine now controuerted, where finding manie friuolous arguments and idle ſolutions, I grew into much greater care to diſcuſſe matters than euer before, leaſt whileſt I thought to goe the right way to Heauen, and to lead others thither, wee went both blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to hell.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Next vnto this occaſion happened another,<note place="margin">The powder-treaſon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion.</note> and that was the moſt vnmatched Pouder-treaſon, as I thinke the moſt odious conſpiracie that euer was inuented or intended by the braine of man; the hatefull memorie whereof will proue euerlaſtingly to all poſteritie a ſpot indelible, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the actors, but alſo to all that ſhall maintaine, approue, and allow of the ſame wiſhing it had had the intended ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, acknowledging no other faultineſſe therein, but the want of that ſucceſſe, which no honeſt or good Chriſtian minde could euer endure. This was ſo great a ſcandale to many, that had they not beene otherwiſe confirmed in the faith of Rome, they would forthwith haue abiured it: and for my ſelfe in particular, when I heard the names read in the proclamation of thoſe who were the chiefe agents therein, I ſtood amazed, fearing that it had beene approued by the Pope vnder-hand; becauſe I thought, if <hi>Garnet, Gerralde,</hi> and <hi>Greeneway</hi> were either agents or concealers thereof, the prouidence of the Ieſuites was ſuch, that they would neuer (whatſoeuer they thought in their iudgements of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe thereof) haue giuen conſent thereunto, without the approbation of higher authoritie; and my concluſion in iudgement was, that if euer I could be aſſured, that the Pope allowed by any conniuencie whatſoeuer of the fact, I ſhould therein rather acknowledge him to be the Vicar of hell, than the Vice-gerent of Chriſt. And further, I was much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, when I heard that <hi>Garnet</hi> ſhould acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25258:18"/>to haue heard of it in Sacramentall confeſſion, and yet to conceale it from the State, and to deniſe no means or way to diſcouer the fact, without opening himſelfe or his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; which the doctrine of his owne Church obliged him vnto,<note place="margin">Silueſt. verbo Confeſsio <hi>§. 3.</hi> num. <hi>2.</hi> prope fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.

Beſides, another thing which bred a great maruaile in me was,<note place="margin">The Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him ſoon after to the dignity of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiarius</hi> in Rome.</note> that the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did neither chaſtiſe <hi>Greenway</hi> for the ſame, conſidering the euidence giuen by his brother <hi>Garnet,</hi> no nor ſo much, as far as euer I could vnderſtand, as giue any publike intimation of diſlike of that hatefull deſignement, which he might haue done by either of his Breues, to the comfort and ſatisfaction of his children here in England, and chiefely to the State, who for his ſilence therein haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that he either winked at it in ſecret before hand, or at leaſt after the ſucceſſe thereof would haue ratified it for the moſt heroicall ſtratageme that euer Catholikes performed, and haue placed him in the Calender of his famouſeſt Martyrs, as M. <hi>Wilſon</hi> hath alreadie done of <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Owldcorne</hi> in his Engliſh Martyrologe, who (as the head Ieſuit hath reported) fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vpon himſelfe that moſt infamous libell, called <hi>Prurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a booke ſo full of blaſphemous application of Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred word, ſo vnreſpectiue to his Maieſtie, ſo iniurious to the State, and ſo enterlaced with laſciuious and beaſtly ſcurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it would ſhame any honeſt man to be eſteemed the author thereof; therefore the Ieſuites doe deale politikely in aſcribing it to a ſecular Prieſt, to make the ſecular Clergie as odious to the State as themſelues; ſince it is well knowne,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25258:18"/>and that not to a few, that the firſt inuenter of the greateſt part of that booke was a faire young Ieſuit, ſometimes a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Vniuerſitie of Louaine, who ſent his firſt inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof to <hi>Parſons</hi> and others at Rome, who made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues full merrie with them, and well approued them; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that father <hi>Talbot,</hi> the Maſter of the Nouices, ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſed, that the reading of ſome of them cauſed him much to be diſtracted in his prayers: and it is to be thought, that that Ieſuit who may beſt chalenge the firſt inuention of that libelling art, when he ſhall come to read his Breuiarie, by the memorie of them he will offer vp a very vnſauorie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe in the ſight of God at theſe words, <hi>Et dixit omnis popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus fiat fiat,</hi> and will proue ſuch a merrie mad petitioner, as will make all the black guard of hell, attending him, to dance for ioy. But to returne to the conſideration of the treaſon, when I arriued beyond the ſeas, and heard ſome to tearme it but an inconſiderate act, as though the ſubſtance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement were not faultie, and when I noted, that I could neuer heare any one Ieſuit to ſpeake reprouingly of it, and further heard ſome very raſhly and fooliſhly to caſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of inuenting it vpon the beſt States-men of this land, as a traine to make Catholikes the more odious to the State, I began to obſerue a cuſtome vſed by ſome, which is without any regard of truth or knowledge to ſpeake the worſt they can to blemiſh the reputation of their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſo I heard a certaine young Ieſuit report, when <hi>Garnet</hi> was in the Tower,<note place="margin">A pretty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</note> that day and night oyle was put into his eyes with feathers, and other means vſed to keepe him from ſleepe, that ſo being weakened both in bodie and minde, he might be eaſily drawne to confeſſe all he knew: which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, with diuers others belonging to this vnmatcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſon, though they made mee not then abandon the faith and beleefe of thoſe that were actors thereof, yet did they ſow ſuch ſeedes of doubtfulneſſe and care in me to be ſound in faith, that the effects and fruits iſſuing from them of doctrine, concerning diſallegeance to the King, which is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25258:19"/>contained in the Popes Breues, hath much auerted me ſince, as namely the doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> teaching, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were not ſubiect to temporall Princes <hi>de iure,</hi> but <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> retracting the former opinion,<note place="margin">Bellarmin. cont.

               <p n="7">7 A third occaſion concurring to my conuerſion,<note place="margin">Conference with others.</note> was conference with others, into whoſe companies by chance I haue falne; as once with a learned Knight, who not knowing me to be a Prieſt, conferred with me as with a profeſſor of the Romane faith, who winded me into ſuch a circle about the Scriptures and the Church, that I could neuer winde my ſelfe out of it, till I winded my ſelfe out of the Romane Church, and ſtayed my ſelfe vpon a ground not admitted there, which is, that the Scriptures are the moſt ſufficient and certaine rule of faith that Chriſtians haue; which if you take away, all religion, all faith, all knowledge of God falleth to the ground. And another time I fell into diſpute with a graue ancient Iuſtice of Peace, who preſſed me ſo farre, that I promiſed to ſend him ſome principall doctrines of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church ſo ſufficiently proued by Scriptures, by Fathers, and by naturall reaſon, that if they could bee anſwered, I would ſubſcribe to his Church; but in the examination of the proofes of thoſe very points, brought in by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and due conſideration of them, I found them to be of very little force to proue the verities intended, as hereafter ſhall appeare, concerning the Maſſe, Tranſubſtantiation, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacrament vnder one kinde to lay people, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, auricular confeſſion, and others; whereupon I haue proued ſince as good as my promiſe, in ioyning my ſelfe to the Church of England.</p>
               <p n="8">8 A fourth occaſion of examining more carefully the

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25258:22"/>inſpired from God.</hi> In which wordes it is here to bee noted, that this Doctor taketh the word <hi>profitable</hi> for <hi>neceſſarie:</hi> which acception of his is repugnant to thoſe Romaniſts that abuſe the meaning of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who onely will haue it ſerue to ſhew the profit of the Scriptures, but not the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of them, and ſo exclude the Scriptures from being the moſt infallible, certaine, and ſufficient rule of ſaluation; therefore this Schoolemans ſence and meaning here is verie remarkable, by the word <hi>profitable,</hi> ſignifying the neceſſitie of a reuealed knowledge.</p>

Hence it was neceſſarie for mans ſaluation, that certaine things which exceede humane reaſon, ſhould be made knowne vnto him by Gods reuelation.</hi> Behold here moſt cleerely an abſolute neceſſitie of a ſupernaturall reuealed knowledge, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſuch things as ſurmount the capacitie of our naturall vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p n="4">4 His words following doe alſo import a conuenient ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie alſo of ſuch knowledge euen for thoſe things belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to ſaluation, which wee know by naturall reaſon.<note place="margin">A conuenient neceſſitie of reuealed knowledge.</note> His words are theſe: <hi>For thoſe things alſo belonging to God, which may be ſearched into by humane reaſon, it was neceſſarie man ſhould be inſtructed by Gods reuelation; becauſe the truth of God ſearched into by reaſon, can be deriued vnto man but by a few, and of a long time, and with the admixtion of many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, vpon the knowledge notwithſtanding of which truth, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25258:23"/>whole ſaluation of man dependeth, which is in God. Therefore, that ſaluation might come vnto men the more conueniently and the more certainely, it was neceſſarie that they ſhould be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of diuine things by diuine reuelation: it was neceſſarie therefore, that beſides Philoſophicall diſciplines, which are found out by reaſon, a ſacred knowledge ſhould be had by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation.</hi> Whence it appeareth, that a reuealed knowledge is required for a twofold neceſſitie, the one abſolute, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> for the greater conueniencie, and for the better auoidance of error, and all to attaine happily the end for which we are created.</p>

Therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a reaſonable creature doth not onely conſiſt in that which is agreeable to it owne nature, but alſo in that which is attributed vnto it by a certaine ſupernaturall perfection of Gods goodneſſe,</hi>

                     </note> The Primitiue, the moderne, and the laſt. In the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſtate, miracles were wrought often, but now ſeldom; and in the laſt ſtate, that is, of Antichriſt, they ſhall be done moſt ſeldome. In the Primitiue ſtate they were done often, becauſe according to Saint <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> the ancient mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles haue admiration, profit and neceſſitie: Therefore then according to Saint <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> miracles were done, as well for admiration, becauſe men being then accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to their ſenſes, were therefore to be lifted vp; as for profit, becauſe then many were infirme and oppreſſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels; and for neceſſitie, becauſe they were infidels and wrapped vp in errors. But in the moderne ſtate they are ſeldome done, becauſe neceſſitie requireth them not, men being now beleeuers; yet ſometimes they are wrought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe profit and vtilitie exalteth them, for that ſometimes men are found weake, and to ſtand in need of them. And why miracles are not done now ſo frequently, as they were in the Primitiue Church, there is a threefold reaſon; one is for the ſtrength of faith; becauſe now the Church is ſtrengthened and eſtabliſhed in faith. This reaſon <hi>Bernard</hi> aſſigneth, putting an example of the plant, into which we power water, till we ſee it faſtened in the earth; ſecondly, for the profitable example of the world,<note place="margin">De ciuit.

                     </note> This reaſon <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> aſſigneth, ſaying, whoſoeuer requireth yet won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he may beleeue, he is a great wonder himſelf, who beleeueth not when the world beleeueth; Thirdly, for the greater merit of faith; becauſe, according to Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> faith hath no merit, where humane reaſon prouoketh it: but in the end they ſhall bee wrought but ſeldome, for three
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:25258:47"/>reaſons, that <hi>Iſidorus</hi> teacheth; either that the hand of the perſecutors may become more bould, or that the patience of the Saints may be the more proued; or that the lightnes may be the more ſhewed of thoſe which ſhall fall.</q> Who ſpeaking heere of the miracles of Saints in theſe three ſtates of time, ſhe weth they ſhall be ſcanty in the middle ages after Chriſt, and very raw in the laſt ages; which if it be true, what can I do but ſuſpect the pretended miracles of the Church of Rome, which ſwarmeth with ſo many bookes repleniſhed with their narrations, in ſuch ſtrange and vnheard manner as there were neuer the like? and therefore they eaſilie ſeeme to ſurmount all beliefe, and I may more largely preſſe thoſe words againſt thoſe of the Church of Rome which this Authour pointeth at, ſaying to all her followers out of Saint <hi>Augustine;</hi>

                  <hi>Why, ſay they, are not the miracles now done, which you doe preach to haue beene done? I might ſay that before the world did beleeue, they were neceſſrie to this end that the world might beleeue, but whoſoeuer doth enquire after wonders, that hee may beleeue, hee himſelfe is a great wonderment, who beleeueth not now the world doth beleeue.</hi> By which words I obſerue a neceſſitie why men ſhould look for miracles in the Primitiue Church, but none why wee ſhould expect them now; but rather why wee ſhould feare to bee deceiued by beleeiuing falſe ones for true ones; and therefore Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> giueth another ſtronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hold him in the Church, than the continuance of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſaying:<note place="margin">Contra Epi. fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenti.</note>

For as it is an argument of chaſt loue to cleaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God; ſo is it the ſigne of an adulterous ſoule in ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things to ſeeke externall ſignes. Further, as the ancient Iewes were contented with the ſignes of their Elders done in the deſert, in the red ſea, on mount Sina,<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>32.</hi>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:25258:49"/>to the meaſure of their eie ſight, haue tolde mee as much; beſides, at the firſt, the picture of this miracle was very ſmall, but now it is greater, and perhappes it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yet a greater ſhape, and be the mother of miracles, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the end of the world, and ſo ſurpaſſe all the miracles done in Chriſts time, which were not permanent, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory; about which if a man ſhould aske the Author of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanus</hi> that monſtrous and athiſticall libell, how ſo ſtrange a miracle could be done, he would ſoone no doubt anſwer you according to his ſacrilegious manner of applying the ſacred Scriptures with the Diuell: <hi>quia ſcriptum est: &amp; maiora hijs facietis.</hi> Which words Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expoundeth of the conuerſions of ſinners by the miniſtery of Preachers, becauſe the conuerſion of ſinners is the greateſt worke of God. Now (beloued Reader) how could I with any reaſon giue credite to this miracle,) howſoeuer at the firſt report I was ouer-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, when I obſerued the maner how it was carried: and if ſuch reuerend Fathers of the chriſtian world, will ſtand in defence of it, and beknaue better men than themſelues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the magiſtracie, as I heard one principal Father do in Bruxels in great choler &amp; indignation againſt thoſe that ſhould gainſay it: I may (beloued) wel call in doubt, &amp; enter into a iealous ſuſpition of many other ſtrange miracles, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the maintenance of vntruth &amp; falſhoode by others of the Roman Church. Secondly, I remember an other ſtrange miracle, had it not proued falſe, for the great credit of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, <q>and their holyſocietie in Perſia. Not long before the diſcouery of the Powder treaſon, ther was diſperſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among ſome of their Catholike friends here in England a litle Pamphlet in the French tongue, reporting the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conuerſion of the King of Perſia,<note place="margin">The miracle of Perſia.</note> by one <hi>Campion</hi> a Ieſuit and Engliſhman, that diſpoſſeſſed one which had a diuell, who commanded the diuell at his departure out of the body, to giue a ſigne therof, by ſtriking downe the top of a ſteeple;whereupon followed the Kings conuerſion, with many of the nobilitie to the Roman faith, with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:25258:50"/>liberty to preach it publikely, and to build vp Churches and monaſteries throughout all his Dominions.</q> Which of many here in England was beleeued to be true, eſpecially by a friend of mine, vnto whom that Pamphlet was ſent, who requeſted me to ſay maſſe in thankeſiguing to GOD for ſo great a benefit; but in the end, that Ieſuit who ſent the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, gaue out, that it was but a thing, deuiſed by French Hugonets, to diſgrace their ſocietie. What ſtrange deuiſes are theſe? What hatefull illuſions wherewith honeſt ſincere ſoules are made gulls, through deceitfulnes and diueliſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, vſing all things for nothing but their owne ends; I can not but now ſmile at my ſelfe, to remember the plaine ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of my heart, in beleeuing this prettie inuention, and with how thankefull a minde I offered vp the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, with a tacite and ſilent wiſh, that God by the like meanes would procure the conuerſion of England.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Thirdly,<note place="margin">Other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded miracles in the Church of Rome.</note> I will not omit here to call to mnind two ſtrange miracles, inuented to the honour of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> that people might be the more excited to pray to him before all others; <q>The firſt I heard preached at S. <hi>Iames</hi> Church in Antwerpe in the Lent time, ſome fiue yeres ſince, by a Capuchine Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and affirmed to be ſuch an euident truth, that no iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions might be entertaind againſt it, before a great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie and confluence of people,<note place="margin">Of one that roaſted her childe.</note> with many particular circumſtances of place and perſons, which made it carrie the more likeliehood of truth with it; and ſince that time, I know where it hath been related by the Prouinciall of the Franciſcans here in England. The ſtorie in briefe is this in effect. A certaine Gentlewoman there was in a towne in Sicilie, ſome few yeeres ſince, that longing much to taſte of the fleſh of her owne child, and yielding fooliſhly by the diuells ſuggeſtions to ſatisfie her deſire, when her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was from home, killed her childe, and cut him into quarters; putting one part on the ſpit, to eate of it, and hanging the other parts vpon hookes b in the kitchin; at length the husband came home &amp; wondred to ſee what a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:25258:50"/>ſtrange piece of fleſh was on the ſpit, asked his maid what it was, who replying, that it was a part of his child, which his wife had killd; he forthwith in a great rage went vnto her, &amp; threatned to kil her; whereat ſhe being both ſory for her ſonne, and afraide of her husband, falling vpon her knees, intreated him for Gods ſake, and the honor of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> that at leaſt, if ſhe muſt needs die, he would giue her leaue to repent her ſinne, and to ſay her prayers, commending her ſoule into Gods hands, and then to doe his pleaſure; which hee graunted: and ſhee praying very earneſtly to S. <hi>Francis,</hi> to whom ſhe was much deuoted, at length, ending her prayers, deſired him to goe with her into the kitchin, and if he ſawe not his child aliue, then to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his pleaſure. O horrible and vnheard miracle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mendacium!</hi> She tooke the parts of the child, aſwell that on the ſpit, which was more than halfe roaſted, as the reſt, &amp; put them together vpon the table, and by the merits of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> they all ioyned togehter, the child reuiued, &amp; came to the ſame ſtate as before; ſo ſhe obtained againe her husbands loue, and be beheld againe his dead childe: S. <hi>Francis</hi> merits hereby exalted, and therefore the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt needs be vnhappy, that man that wil not pray to S. <hi>Francis.</hi> Gentle reader, if you haue more faith than I, you may beleeue this miracle, if you be piouſly affected, you cannot (as the Franciſcan ſaith) but beleeue it, and wholy offer vp all your prayers to holieſt S. <hi>Francis,</hi> the chiefeſt Saint in heauen.</q>

In the time that S. <hi>Francis</hi> dwelled in the citty of Engubi, there was within the territory of the ſame city, a certaine terrible wolfe, of mighty bignes in body, &amp; moſt fierce in the rage of his hunger, that did not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure beaſts, but alſo men and women, inſomuch that hee kept the citiſens in ſuch fear, that when they went forth of the Cittie, they went out armed as if they had gone to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:25258:51"/>warres,<note place="margin">How Saint <hi>Francis</hi> tamed a wolfe.</note> and hardly could they ſo ſcape from being ſorely bitten with his ſharpe teeth, if they chaunced to meet him, ſo that ſcarce durſt any goe alone out of the Cittie gates for feare of meeting him. But God determining to make manifeſt vnto the ſame Citizens the holineſſe of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> when vpon a time hee was in the ſame Cittie, mooued the Saint with a charitable compaſſion of their miſerie and vexation to afford them helpe. Whereuppon hee purpoſed to goe and meete the Wolfe, vnto whome the Cittizens ſaide; Take heede father <hi>Francis,</hi> goe not out of the Cittie, for if you doe, the woolfe which bath deuoured many, will alſo deuoure you. But Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> not diſmayed with their wordes, but hoping confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in Chriſts aſſiſtance, who commaundeth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of all fleſh; went foorth of the Cittie with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, not with buckler or helmet, but armed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the ſigne of the holie Croſſe. Thus the holie father beeing confidently out of the Towne, and manie looking on from ſuch places as they had climbed vp to expect the euent; the terrible woolfe eftſoones with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mouth ranne to Saint <hi>Frauncis</hi> and his companion, againſt whoſe furie the good Father oppoſed the ſigne of the Croſſe, and ſo through Gods power, kept backe the woolfe both from himſelfe and his companion, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his courſe, and ſhutte his mouth, and further ſaide vnto him; Come hither brother woolfe, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Chriſt Ieſus I commaund thee, neyther to hurt mee, nor anie other. Whereupon foorthwith inclining his head vpon the ground, hee proſtrated himſelfe at the feete of the holie Saint, as gently as a Lambe. To whom thus proſtrate, Saint <hi>Frauncis</hi> ſaid: Brother woolfe, thou doeſt much hurt in theſe partes, and haſt committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie horrible and grieuous crimes, deſtroying the good creatures of God without all pittie or mercie, and thou doeſt not onelie deſtroy vnreaſonable Creatures, but which is a meere madneſſe in thee, thou doeſt deuoure
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:25258:51"/>men who are created to the ſimilitude &amp; likeneſſe of God; therefore thou art worthy to die a moſt violent death like a moſt notorious Theefe and Murderer, for the which, all doe iuſtly exclaime and murmure againſt thee, and the whole Citie is thy Enemie. But Brother Wolfe I will make a peace betweene you and them, vpon condition thou hurt them no more, and they alſo ſhall, forgiuing thee all offences, not hurt or proſecute thee, neither ſhall dogs barke at thee. Which the Wolfe ſeemed kindly to accept by the geſtures of his taile, eares, body, and inclination of his head: Vnto whom S. <hi>Francis</hi> againe replied. Brother Wolfe, ſince it pleaſeth thee to make this peace, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee I will procure that thy expences and neceſſarie victualls ſhall daily be giuen thee by the Citizens, ſo that hereafter thou ſhalt neuer bee hungrie in exceſſe. For I know that the euill thou doeſt proceedeth from the furie of thy hunger. But brother Wolfe, ſince I obtaine thee ſo great a benefit, I will haue thee promiſe mee neuer to hurt either Man or Beaſt: doeſt thou promiſe me this? The Wolfe then made an euident ſigne by the inclination of his head, of promiſing to performe that which the Saint required, and impoſed vpon him. But brother Wolfe then ſaid S. <hi>Francis,</hi> I will haue thee vpon thy credit to aſſure me, by giuing mee thy faith and promiſe,<note place="margin">A good ieſt.</note> that I may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beleeue what thou promiſeſt. So S. <hi>Francis</hi> holding out his hand for aſſurance of his promiſe, the Wolfe lifted vp his right fore-foot, and very ſoftly and gently alied it in his hand, ſo engaging his credit to him by the beſt ſigne he could; then againe S. <hi>Francis</hi> ſaid, Brother Wolfe I command thee in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, now preſently to go along with me into the Citie without feare of hurt, to conclude this peace with thee and the Citie: whoſe command the wolfe obeied, and accompanied him very quietly into the Citie like a moſt mild Lamb, which put the Citizens, that ſaw it, in a great wonder, and the report thereof was inſtantly ſpred ouer all the Towne, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:25258:52"/>all Men and Women, yong and old, flocked thither where S. <hi>Francis</hi> was with the Wolfe. When the people were thus gathered together S. <hi>Francis</hi> made them an excellent Sermon, telling them amongſt other things that ſuch vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are granted by God for the ſinnes of the people, and how much more dangerous was the conſuming flame of hell, which ſhall euerlaſtingly deuoure the damned, than the madneſſe of a wolfe, which can but deuoure the body, and how dreadfull it is to be drowned in the gulfe of hell, ſince ſo great a multitude of people were ſo much kept in feare by the perill of one litle beaſt. Returne, returne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore D. B. to our Lord, doe worthy penance, God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer you from the preſent danger of the Wolfe, and from the future danger of hells deuouring fire. And then ſaid further, marke me well beloued, my brother Wolfe who ſtandeth quietly here before you, hath promiſed mee, and hath alſo giuen me aſſurance of his promiſe vpon his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, to make peace with you, and neuer to hurt you in any thing, vpon condition that you ſhall alſo giue your promiſe to maintaine him; &amp; I for my Brother Wolfe will be ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he ſhall firmely obſerue, and faithfully keepe this couenant of peace with you; with that all that were there cried out aloud, promiſing alwaies to cheriſh and feede the Wolfe. And S. <hi>Francis</hi> in the preſence of them all, ſaid, and thou brother Wolfe doeſt thou promiſe to hold peace with them, and that thou wilt hurt neither Beaſt nor Perſon of theirs? then the Wolfe made ſhew of promiſing to keepe peace, by falling vpon his knees, inclining his head, and other geſtures, of taile, and eares, full of blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhment; Saint <hi>Francis</hi> then ſaid: But brother Wolfe, I will haue thee now before all here preſent to giue me aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of thy promiſe, as thou didſt without the gate, and that thou wilt keepe this peace, and that thou wilt not offend in the ſuretie made. Then the Wolfe lifting vp his right fore-foot, made promiſe in the hand of S. <hi>Francis</hi> his ſuretie, in the ſight of all, whereupon there was ſuch
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:25258:52"/>admiration and ioy of all, as well for the deuotion of the Saint, as for the newneſſe of the miracle, as alſo for the peace betweene the Wolfe and the People, that all gaue thankes vnto God, praiſing Almightie God, who by the merits of his Saint had deliuered them from the mouth of the fierce Beaſt, and reſtored them quietneſſe and ſafetie from ſo fearefull a vexation.<note place="margin">An honeſt Wolfe.</note> Now after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Wolfe alwaies kept his promiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions ordained by Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and liuing in the Cittie two yeares, going vp and downe from doore to doore, begging his foode without hurting any, or being hurt of any, was louingly cheriſhed and fedde of all, and which is more ſtrange, there neuer did Dogge barke at him. At length the Wolfe died, and the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were very ſorrie for his death, becauſe the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſight and preſence of the Wolfe, did maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly renew in them the memorie of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> vertue and ſanctitie.</q> I noted this Miracle related by ſuch Authours, as a thing not only ridiculous to any iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hearer thereof, but as alſo moſt erroneous in the circumſtances; as namely where Saint <hi>Francis</hi> telleth the VVolfe of his horrible crimes committed, againſt Men and Beaſts; and telleth him further that becauſe hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured men created to Gods ſimilitude, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee was worthy to die like a Theefe, and Murderer: whereby it ſeemeth hee inſinuates that a bruit beaſt, doing that which is naturall vnto him, committeth ſinne, which can not bee ſinne vnleſſe it bee voluntarie; and that this humble VVolfe was ſo intelligent, as that hee knew man to be created to Gods ſimilitude and likeneſſe; therefore a fit miracle for Fooles and Children.</p>

Whereat all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants admiring, determined to deferre his buriall till the next day; when, thinking to performe the exequies, they came againe to that paſſage afoteſaid of the office of the dead, he ſuddainely roſe vp againe, and cryed out with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Iusto Dei iudicio iudicaetus ſum,</hi> that is to ſay, I am iudged by the iuſt iudgement of God.

Whereto verie early the next morning all the towne flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being deſirous to know the euent of ſo ſtrange, rare, and fearefull a iudgement of God: when hauing begun againe the office of the dead, and comming to the ſame paſſage aboue ſpecified, he rayſed himſelfe vp the third time, and to the great horror of all the ſtanders by, he ſaid, <hi>Iuſto Dei iudicio condemnatus ſum;</hi> that is, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the iuſt iudgement of God:</q>

Whereat <hi>Bruno,</hi> with others, were ſo much terrified, that they framed a more ſtrict order than euer was before, tearmed Carthuſians, that by the ſtrictneſſe of that life they might be the better prepared for the ſtrict iudgements of God. In the conſideration of his miracle, if it were true, and no hypocriticall cunning vſed therein, I cannot conceiue, but that it makes more againſt the faith of Rome than for it; of which profeſſion this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, whileſt he liued, was reputed both to be a learned and holy Saint: For firſt, if he were ſo holy and learned, no doubt he knew what belonged to preparation for his death: and therefore howſoeuer hee might bee depriued of outward meanes, or helpe of the Sacraments, yet it is to be preſumed, that at leaſt, in <hi>voto Sacramenti,</hi> he would excite himſelfe, as much as lay in him, to be penitent for his ſinnes. And it is to be thought his Holineſſe would not permit him to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:25258:54"/>of that which lay in his power to performe. And laſtly, ſince there is no cauſe regiſtred of his damnation, but knowne onely to God, he being both a profeſſor and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Romane faith, it may as well be preſumed (ſo farre as man, for his ſoules benefit, may enter into Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets) that God ſhewed this extraordinarie iudgement, to manifeſt to the world, that though his life was neuer ſo good in the ſight of the world, or his learning ſo great, yet where true faith is wanting, no ſaluation can be attained, and that therefore the Romane faith cannot be the true faith. This is the fitteſt collection I can make of this miracle, becauſe he was a Doctor profeſſing that faith of Rome, and liued and died therein.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25258:59"/>ſaid Gentleman not ſuſpecting any guile vnder the cloake of a religious profeſſion, arriued at Rome, and by the meanes of this holy Father was committed to the Inquiſition where hee was kept ſome moneth priſoner, vpon pretence of a booke which hee had publiſhed with approbation of thoſe that were to allow of it in the Low Countries, and humble ſubmiſſion thereof in his Preface to the Churches cenſure in all points taught therein, like a ſincere child of that Church, as then he was, and like a true Iſraelite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraude or guile: herein appeared the rauenous Wolfe in a Sheepes skinne. VVhat a woluiſh diſpoſition may it bee thought this man bore to his Maieſtie and the State, who were of a contrarie religion to him, ſince hee appeared ſo cruell to one that profeſſed the Romane ſaith; that ſuffered baniſhment for the ſame; that for zeale to that Church left the way hee was in to preferment at home, and found little charitie or kindneſſe abroade? VVhen the ſame good father further would profeſſe great deſire of the Secular Prieſts good proceedings here in England; when hee would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate other mens want of charitie in diſgracing the good Fathers of his order, with ſome perſonall imputations, ſaying, it was an vncharitable part for any ſo to diſcouer any mans imperfections; herein appeared the garment of a ſheep. But when publikely he read a letter from England amongſt the Schollers at Rome, diſcloſing the horrible ſinne of one <hi>William</hi> a Prieſt, that had many yeares liued too familiarly with a Tailors wife, whereof the Tailor hauing notice, caried a dagge vnder his cloake vp &amp; down London ſtreets to ſhoot him to death, for ſo ſacrilegious and adulterous an act: and this, as he ſaid, was an earneſt Appealant; at which time four of the Appealants were in Rome to proſecute the Prieſts cauſe againſt the Ieſuits, &amp; M. <hi>Blackwel,</hi> of which charitable report, I being then a Student of that Colledge, was my ſelfe an ear-witneſſe, yet could I neuer ſince vpon diligent enquiry vnderſtand any ſuch ſtorie to bee true of any Prieſt in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: and therefore herein appeared the rauenous VVolfe.

This may ſeeme probably apparent, if we remember the letter that was ſent by <hi>Garnet</hi> ſome few monethes before his trouble to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> ſignifying from father <hi>Aquauiua</hi> the <hi>Generall of the Ieſuites,</hi> that his Holineſſe gaue order that all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes heere in England ſhould behaue themſelues quietly and dutifully towards his Maieſtie, without giuing offence, or raiſing any tumults about matters of religion: which ſome thought to haue beene by reaſon of the commotion that happened in Wales about that time, whereof perhaps the Pope might haue ſome inckling; yet I find that men of farther reach, obſeruing the ſucceſſe of the intended pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-treaſon following ſoone after, haue obſerued that that letter which maſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> ſhould haue ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Catholikes, was but a cloake of the ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement of the powder-day, to take away all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger in the ſtate, whereof it is probably thought that both the Pope and father <hi>Aquauiua</hi> were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſely, or circumſtantially made acquainted with that buſineſſe; nay moreouer my ſelfe ſtrongly vrging againſt one the vnlawfulnes of the powder-deſignement, he wiſhed me to be ſilent, for it was more then probable that the Pope knew well thereof: and in ſpeaking againſt it I ſhould but cauſe the Ieſuites to diſaffect me and doe my ſelfe no good. Hereupon I grew ſilent, and thought the more then of ſuch horrible hypocriſie, for that ſome reported that both the Pope and Cardinals had ſpoken publikely againſt it, which me thought could not hang well together without ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable hypocriſie; eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Greenway</hi> by the Pope was not only ſuffered to liue in Rome, but alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted euen before the Popes face to the dignitie of being one
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25258:60"/>of his Penitentiaries appointed publikly to heare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in Rome, and <hi>Gerard</hi> likewiſe ſuffered to liue quietly in Flanders without checke or controule by any man, who made ſuch deep proteſtations to one maſter <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Prieſt, vpon his ſaluation, that he had no wayes notice of the powder-deſignement, that as I heard the ſaid maſter <hi>Buckland</hi> ſay, either he muſt needs beleeue him to affirme a truth, or elſe that he was as great an hypocrite and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler as euer liued in the world. So like are the followers of the Romane Church to the firſt kind of the Phariſies hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, in pretending outward holineſſe, whileſt in their hearts they harbour moſt deteſtable vnrighteouſneſſe. Therefore well did Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> deſcribe Hypocrites, ſaying, that they were; <hi>Mordaces vt canes, doloſi vt vulpes, ſuperbi vt leones;</hi> they are biting like dogges, they are guilefull like foxes, they are proud like lions: for ſuch will ſuffer no mans reputation to be vntoucht, but will teare it with their ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teeth; they are craftie as foxes, which teare in peeces the ſheepe of the beſt wooll, and as proud as lions, for that they contemne all, diſgrace all without regard to any mans perſon or dignitie.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond kind of Romiſh hypocriſie.</note> I haue alſo obſerued the ſecond kind of the Phariſies hypocriſie, to be very abundant in the Church of Rome, which conſiſteth in a prepoſterous, and defectiue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holines, breeding ſcrupuloſity in trifles, and largenes of conſcience in matters of more moment. As for example, I find that for violating their cuſtome &amp; obſeruation vpon faſting-dayes, many will bee exceedingly ſcandalized, but giue no ſhew of ſcandale-taking at the moſt wicked example of the powder-treaſon, or the traytors thereof, but rather by their ſilence ſeeme willing to approue it, &amp; to lament only the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of their deſired ſucceſſe. Others there are that will controule and checke any raſh iudgement euen in trifles in others, who themſelues without ſcruple or knowledge, or iudgment, wil not ſtick to lay the imputation of the powder-treaſon vpon Proteſtants themſelues, who ſhould by Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillian
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:25258:61"/>complotments be the firſt contriuers of it, to draw Papiſts vnto it, thereby to make them the more odious to the world. Againe, the Church of Rome forbiddeth Prieſts to be married, which is lawfull by the law of God: and whereas mariages betwixt kindred in the degrees of affinity are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the law of God, they ſuffer and permit, diſpencing with mens conſciences therein, as for example; that one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may marry his brothers wife, which was allowed in this kingdom by the Pope; that the neece may marry her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which hath bin granted but to mean perſons euen of late yeeres in Hamp-ſhire, by authoritie granted from the Pope. What ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more prepoſterous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make a law which God neuer made, &amp; in liew therof to diſanull an inſtitution which God hath made? Beſides, the Popes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſuffer ſome of the Clergie to profeſſe external pouertie, as the poore Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins, whileſt themſelues and others liue in all pompe, iollity and pleaſure, vſing all coulors of holines to enrich the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and to draw treaſures out of al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries to fill the Exchequer of S. <hi>Peter</hi> withall. Who ſees not moſt plainly that many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſoules, whileſt for the grant of indulgences yearely to this Church and that Church, they pay round ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the Romane offices; they grow negligent in ſeeking pardon from God, and ſo neuer obtain truly pardon for their ſins? what ſhall I ſay of their prepoſterous zeale in keeping holidaies? I often noted that the daies appointed in memory of Saints, are much more ſolemnely kept, then Sonday which is the feaſt of their Lord and Maſter; &amp; in ſtead of one prayer to the Father, or to the holy Ghoſt, or the bleſſed Trinity, the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that Church do ſay many either to the virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or to S. <hi>Francis,</hi> S. <hi>Benet, Beatus Ignatius,</hi> or ſome other Saint to whom they are moſt peculiarly addicted. By all which examples, I obſerue the Church of Rome much alſo to exceed in this prepoſterous hypocriſie, and externall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, without any order or rule.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third kind of Romane hypocriſie.</note> I haue further entred into a deepe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the third kind of Phariſaicall hypocriſie, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth

But it was more than verball, when a deuoted follower of the Ieſuites went to the maſter of the Poſtes in Bruxells, and there paied for a Packet of Letters, ſent to a Benedictin Monke out of Spaine, pretending that he was his friend, and affirming, that he would ſee them ſafly deliuerd to the party to whom they were directed: yet firſt he was ſo friendly vnto him, that he opened the packet of Letters; went and ſhewed them to the Ieſuite Legier in Bruxells; and when all was done, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them by the helpe and light hand of a truſtie Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ladie, cunning both in opening and ſealing, encloſed them vp againe ſo artificially, excepting one which was of greateſt importance that miſcaried; &amp; yet by gulling a fourth perſon, ſent them at length to the honeſt Moncke, to whom they were directed. Is not this verie curteous charitie in the religious Ieſuite towardes his religious brother of an other Order, profeſſing with him the like euangelicall Councels of perfection? this is no hypocriſie, but curteſie. This is but kind charitie, to pay for an other mans letters, and to ſend them to the owner, without ſuffering him to pay poſtage: to take away one letter of moſt weight, whereupon the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of the Benedictins affaires written from their Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25258:64"/>which is taught by ſuch hypocriticall teachers; yet when I conſidered further more particularly the meanes, which in the iudgement of Papiſts themſelues our Sauiour teacheth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to vſe for the diſcouerie of them, much more haue I beheld the corruption of the Roman religion, and beene moued to beartier repentance and greater commiſeration of poore ſeduced Popiſts here in England, who in a good ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie and erroneous aſſurance of their religion, are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly led by many of their teachers, into a wonderfull blind obedience, not onely to the temporall detriment of their ſtates and fortunes, and hazard of worldly meanes for their poſterities, but alſo which is worſe, to the great perrill of their ſoules euerlaſting ruine and deſtruction; for whoſe good alſo I haue thought good to giue them ſome meanes of redreſſe, by explicating vnto them the meanes diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt, wherewith they might helpe themſelues, as alſo the maner of my proceeding in the conſideration of this point.</p>

               <p>Againe, what proceedeth from the prohibition of Prieſts marriage, but infinite and almoſt innumerable ſinnes againſt nature, as beſtialitie, Sodomie, vnnaturall euacuations, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, adulterie, fornication, ſacriledges, and a thouſand other abominations, which abound in the preſent Church of Rome, whileſt that lawfull wedlocke, and honorable bed which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth vndefiled, may not be permitted, nor commended, without imputation of incontinencie, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and filthy pollution, which is truely the doctrine of Diuells, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> termeth it. I omit to ſpeake how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny virgins haue beene defloured, how many matrons diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, how many monaſtcries peruerted, how many good husbands wronged, how many widdowes abuſed, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wilfull abortments, how many ſlaughters of children,

Ninthly, becauſe the Maſſe in his kind is as full of myſteries as the ſea of drops, as the Sunne of beames, as the firmament of Starres, as the imperiall heauen of Angels. Tenthly, becauſe Prieſts in ſolemne Churches, haue in their Maſſe many Miniſters; the Deacon, Subdeacon, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25258:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>Acolytes. Eleuenthly, becauſe the Angels being there in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſuch maieſtie, it ſufficeth vs to be ſchollers. Twelfthly, becauſe there is the Lord of heauen and earth.</hi> I might vnto theſe twelue adde the effects of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, taught by <hi>Bernardinus de Buſto,</hi> who amongſt many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very ridiculous, putteth for one this prerogatiue;<note place="margin">Bern. de Bust. in ſer. de Sacrif. Miſ.</note> viz. <hi>quamdin quis audit ſacrum not ſeneſcit,</hi> man waxeth not old ſo long as hee heares Maſſe. When I read theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, after it had pleaſed God to giue me a true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Maſſes idolatries, I could not but grieue that men ſhould be thus deceiued by the diuels ſuggeſtions, as to giue credit vnto ſuch idle deuiſes for the maintenance of Gods diſhonor and the diuels ſeruice. Is it not a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, thinke you, of the Maſſe, that the Prieſt muſt be faſting, before he go to take a peece of wafer, and a prertie quantitie of good Maligo, rich Canarie, or other ſtrange wine? I trow it is a prettie breakfaſt to take three draughts of ſuch wine, although there be a few drops of water in the laſt. This priuiledge I haue obſerued pleaſeth the Ieſuites beſt of all, who ſcorne to haue weake wine, as Clarret, but commonly make prouiſion of the beſt comfortable Sackes for that purpoſe; and will lightly take more into the Challice then any other Prieſts, out of a greater care they haue that no particles of Chriſts ſacred fleſh ſhould ſtay about the ſides of the Chalice, which religious care is a good faire cloake for them to warme their faſting ſtomackes with the more bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and full draught; ſo that in truth this faſting priuiledge of the Maſſe, ſerues but for a colour to haue a good breakfaſt, and ſo to comfort the Prieſts ſtomacke, that many a Lay man would be full glad of the like. The other prerogatiues as weakly grounded vpon mans inuentions, not on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Apoſtolicall traditions, in truth are as meane; but eſpecially that great prerogatiue of the Maſſe, viz. that a man groweth not old ſo long as he heareth Maſſe, is one of the fooliſheſt conceits of a Franciſcan Frier that euer I heard or read. For if it were true, there is no Doctor <hi>Steuens</hi> water
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:25258:83"/>could ſo preſerue a mans life, or prolong it, as the hearing of a Maſſe, and I thinke many would heare more Maſſes then they doe, if this were ſound Diuinitie: but by this it is eaſie to diſcouer the Maſſe not to be as the Church of Rome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, a principall act of religion, and a worke that ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all the workes that euer God wrought, as the worke of creation and redemption; (more miracles appearing in the Sacrament then in either of them, as may be obſerued in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes de Combis:</hi>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:25258:83"/>was; which afterward when being releaſed, he returned againe to his wife, he told her as much with great admiration; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the wife enquiring the time and the houre when hee found him ſo freed from his fetters, ſhe found it happened at he ſame houre, that Maſſe was ſaid for him.</hi> Whereupon Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> ſaith; <hi>Hence, my best beloued brethren and good friends, learne ye how much the ſacred hoaſt being offred by our ſelues, is of force to vntie the bands of our hearts, ſince being offered by one, it had ſuch power, as to breake the bands of anothers bodie.</hi> Certainly if this ſacrifice be of ſuch force, I maruaile why the Prieſts in priſon, offering it with the deuotion of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Confeſſors heere in England, ſhould not be able often to looſen their chaines, yea and to open the verie priſon gates for their deliuerance; but this cannot be, becauſe ſuch fictions neuer prooue true, and theſe are but fables inuented to delude poore ſimple ſoules, that Prieſts by ſaying of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for them may emptie their purſes, and bee partakers of their coine.

Therefore had <hi>Gelaſius</hi> beliefe beene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the preſent Church of Rome concerning Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, he not only could not thereby haue confuted <hi>Eutiches,</hi> but <hi>Eutiches</hi> might by that very doctrine moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably haue confuted him.

Secondly for ſignification, becauſe this Sacrament is a memoriall of the Lords Paſsion, in the which the bloud was ſpearated from the bodie; ſo diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bread as a Sacrament of the bodie, and wine as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bloud. Thirdly for the effect, in reſpect of the whole Church, which conſisteth of diuers beleeuers: ſo the bread is made of diuers cornes, and the wine of diuers grapes.</hi> Out of this ground it ſeemeth, that the Ieſuit in Rome deliuered in the Schoole the definition of this Sacrament in this manner, which I tooke from his mouth with mine owne penne; which is,<note place="margin">De ſacramentis tract. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That the Euchariſt is a Sacrament, which vnder the formes of bread and wine containeth the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, for the nouriſhment of ſpirituall life giuen by Baptiſme.</hi> From all which doctrine I moſt clearely gather, that bread and wine iointly miniſtred belongeth to this Sacrament; and that without ouerthrowing the eſſence of this Sacrament, according to our aduerſaries owne Teachers, it cannot be giuen vnder one kind to the lay people: for it is to be giuen to lay people according to the eſſentiall parts thereof, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt: but according to theſe Writers, the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all parts thereof are bread and wine iointly, as the matter; the forme being the wordes of conſecration, iointly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ouer either forme, <hi>ergo</hi> the bread and wine <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctim</hi> are to be miniſtred to ther people for the integritie of the Sacrament. Whence it followeth, that the Church of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:25258:94"/>Rome, by the amputation of one forme vtterly croſſeth and ouerthroweth the nature of the Sacrament, and ſo maketh it no Sacrament at all, becauſe ſo it wanteth an eſſentiall part thereof.

Few daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Biſhop redemanded againe his money with great importunitie, vnto whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> gaue good wordes, promiſing to repay him ſoone after: but the Biſhop was not contented, but vſed him with ſome violence, vttering iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches againſt him, calling him impoſtor and coſener. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> nothing troubled, ſpit in his face, wherewith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſtrucken blind, he fell to the ground; whereupon at length he acknowledged his fault, crauing pardon. Then <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phanius</hi> ſhewed him into what a gulfe of couetouſneſſe hee was plunged, &amp; putting his hand vpon his head, reſtored him his right eye againe; who praying him to reſtore him alſo his left eye, the holy man refuſed it, to the end he ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies warned by that marke, euer after to vſe more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, and more carefully to auoid that plague of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:25258:97"/>repreſentation of the Biſhop of Rome his inſatiable auarice, now that hee is come to ſuch temporall greatneſſe in this world; and conſequently of the ſpirituall blindneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath ſtrooken him for the ſame, not ſuffering him to ſee the light of truth, but to runne head-long into diuers inextricable hereſies, as a iuſt puniſhment for ſuch his greedy deſires; for the nouelties, which are now broched in the Church of Rome, were not knowne till this hateful ſinne of auarice tooke hold of the Popes,<note place="margin">Indulgences grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of Popes.</note> and drew them to employ their ſtudies more in gathering together temporall wealth, than the riches of Gods graces, and true knowledge of the Scriptures. For hence and from this ſource only hath flowed diuers points of doctrine, now currant in Rome, more tending to the amplification and enlarging of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kingdome, than the Kingdome of Chriſts Church amongſt which the doctrine of Pardons and Indulgences is not the leaſt profitable for the filling vp of the Popes cofers, and giuing contentment to his auaricious deſires, arguing the great ſpirituall blindneſſe God hath permitted him to fall into in puniſhment of the deteſtable ſinne.</p>

Firſt, I beganne to examine the true nature of theſe Romiſh Indulgences and Pardons by the definition of them, which I found in Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> to be thus expreſſed.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de poenit. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>Indulgences <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> are the remiſſions of paines, which are to be endured after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of faults, granted vnto the faithfull for a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe by the high Biſhops out of a Fatherly lenitie and condeſcention. <hi>Ioannes Viguerius the great Scholler of Spaine calleth Indulgence:</hi>

Whereupon firſt I note out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that theſe pardons are not to bee granted without a reaſonable cauſe, and according to <hi>Viguerius</hi> with iudgement of diſcretion; yet notwithſtanding this is contradicted by <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> the Ieſuite, who ſaith: <q>That ſome ſay an Indulgence giuen without cauſe is of value;<note place="margin">Verbo Indulgen. num. <hi>1.</hi> Bonauent. <hi>4.</hi> d. <hi>20.2.</hi> part. q. vlt.

Secondly, I note out of <hi>Silueſter,</hi> that the ſubiect of Indulgences is a ſinner, I meane, as hee ſaith, it is graunted to a ſinner; and yet this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee contradicted by him and others; who ſaith: <hi>Hee that is not in Gods grace obtaineth not Indulgence.</hi>

But the Church as is ſaid taketh Indulgence for the application of penalties of ſupererogations, of Chriſt, and his Saints, by which paines are remitted; therefore nothing is more manifeſt than that the name of Indulgence is found in the ſacred Letters, according to the intention which the Church vſeth.</hi> Here I ſee a braue proofe of a vaunting Spaniard, who with his Spaniſh Brauadoes thinks to haue conquered, but I beleeue when hee ſhall haue found the ſtrength and truth of his encounterers, whom hee termeth Heretiques; if he were now aliue, he would ſay as I haue heard repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted once by an Engliſh Gentleman, that ſerued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amongſt them of a Countriman of his; who figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Souldiers of the Reformed Religion in the Low Countries, and finding his powder ſo moiſt that with often putting match to it, it would not take fire, in moſt blaſphemous manner, ſee ſwore in the Spaniſh tongue. <hi>I vow to God, that this day, I thinke, God is become a Lutheran.</hi> For in very truth if the Texts which <hi>Viguerius</hi> citeth, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, thinking by them to ouerthrow all the Lutheranes in the world, be well and rightly vnderſtood, you ſhall finde them to be of no efficacie at all, and to be but match &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without fire; that is, Scripture and his owne ſenſe, and priuate vnderſtanding without the fire of the holy Ghoſt, without the Spirit of truth, and the comfortable Maſter teaching all truth; for the prophecie of <hi>Eſay</hi> only foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how Chriſt the Meſſias, comming into the world, ſhould Preach the remiſſion of ſinners to all in generall, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie to thoſe that liued in the darkneſſe of ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming to Chriſt as the Gentills, who ſhould finde mercy and truth by Chriſt as well as the Iewes. Neither will I denie, (which maketh nothing for <hi>Viguerius</hi>) but that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:25258:99"/>the remiſſion of ſinnes, and alſo the remiſſion of paines due to ſinne, is meant by the word Indulgence, the infinite guilt of ſinne, and the eternall paine due to ſinne in hell fire, (both which belong to ſinne) being taken away by the bloud of Chriſt, and therefore if the eternall paine, why not alſo the temporal? what reſeruation did Chriſt make, or his Apoſtles, to ſhew that the ternall pain ſhould be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the temporall be reſerued only for the Pope, to be pardoned by means of croſſes, medalls, graines, rings, knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cords, and the like childiſh trinkets?

Who out of the ſhame ſhee had conceiued, for hauing committed ſo enormous an offence, remained for the ſpace of eleuen yeares without going to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to her Curate, who entertaining this religious cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and obſeruing them in their carriages to bee ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and grane, and not to haue any acquaintance with her, and conſidering that perhaps they might neuer come againe to her houſe, ſhee thought ſhee might doe well to make her confeſsion to the elder of the two, and chiefly in reſpect of his authoritie. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhee went to him, deſiring him to heare her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion; who being willing, bad his companion to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe a little a ſide, which he did; yet ſometimes caſting his eies towardes them, he perceiued that at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinne the Lady confeſſed, a Toade went out of her mouth: but being at laſt neare the point of confeſsing her moſt odious and deteſtable ſinne, where with her ſoule was charged, for feare and ſhame ſhee durſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it; whereupon the yong religious Frier, who ſtood at the end of the Chappell, ſaw all the mentioned Toades returne againe into her mouth. Soone after theſe two religious men departed; and being vpon the way, the yongeſt beganne to tell the elder that which hee had ſcene when the Lady was at confeſsion with him; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the elder vnderſtood that the ſame Lady,<note place="margin">A ſtrange tale about a Ladie not confeſsing all her ſinnes.</note> willingly and to her knowledge had concealed ſome ſinne, which ſhee had not confeſſed, who forthwith returned backe againe vnto her, to admoniſh her to looke well to her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but alas hee found her dead. And as hee praied to God for her three daies together, at length ſhee appeared vnto him with a chaine of redde hot yron
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:25258:109"/>about her necke, with two Serpents embracing her, and ſucking her breaſts, with two Toades in her cies; from her mouth and noſtrills iſſued forth fire and brimſtone, and about the haire of her head there were a great number of Lizardes: who ſaid vnto him. O Father I am that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed and miſerable woman, that two daies ſince made a confeſsion vnto you, but becauſe I did willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the ſinne of Adulterie and Inceſt, behold I am dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for euer. With that the Confeſſarius adiured her by the liuing God to declare two thinges vnto him; firſt, the ſignification and meaning of theſe diuers paines. Vnto whom ſhee anſwered, that the Lizards crawling about her head, were for the puniſhment of the dreſsings ſhee wore about her head: the two Toades which couered hereies, were the puniſhment of her wanton and laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious lookes: the flaming darts were for puniſhment of her detractions, defamations, foule and diſhoneſt ſongs and ſpeeches: The two Serpents which ſucke my breaſts ſignifie the foule touchings which haue beene committed vpon mee: The crueltie of the Dogges that deuoure my handes, are puniſhments for mine owne vnchaſt touchings of my ſelfe, and for that I haue giuen preſents vnto my Louers, out of the goodes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I might haue relecued the poore Seruants of CHRIST IESVS: I am ſeated vpon this Dragon that putteth mee to vnſpeakable paine and torment, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my legges and thighes in puniſhment of all my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deedes. Then the <hi>Penitentiarius</hi> willed her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his other doubt, namely for what ſinnes men of theſe times were principally damned. Shee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that men went downe to Hell for all manner of ſinnes: but women chiefly for foure ſorts of ſinnes; for the ſinne of luxurie; for their ſinnes of vaine apparell and painting; for witch-craft; and for their ſhame to confeſſe their ſinnes. And ſo when ſhee had ſaid thus much, the Dragon with a wonderfull great noiſe, raiſed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:25258:109"/>vp himſelfe, and carried her to hell, where ſhee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in endleſſe torments.</q> If this were a true ſtorie, no doubt it would make much for auricular confeſſion: but the cauſe of ſuſpition is, that there is no place named where this ſhould happen, or where this Ladie dwelt: beſides, it ſtandeth onely vpon the bare relation of a Frier (which kinde of people are by many much ſuſpected of forgerie in ſuch deuiſes and lying miracles) which often the very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of them doe diſcouer to be falſe. Is it likely, that ſhe, who had long concealed her ſinnes, would haue gone at all to confeſſion, vnleſſe ſhee had purpoſed to open them, he being a ſtranger and vnknowne? But the ſtorie may ſerue, in Friers iudgements, to terrifie poore women withall, as the Popes Anathemaes doe terrifie many men, who ſtand more in feare of them than of Gods threatnings. But ſweet Ieſus keepe men from beleeuing ſuch lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and giue them grace not to giue eare to any thing not warranted in Scriptures, or iuſtified by antiquitie, and as thou haſt mercifully led me from beleeuing ſuch lyes, ſo of the ſame goodneſſe impart alſo the ſhining beames of truth vnto others, and graunt, that thy onely two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Baptiſme and the holy Euchariſt, iuſtituted by thy ſelfe, may haue their due eſteeme, and other inſtitutions to be eſteemed not as Sacraments, but as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters profitable for vſe, and fit to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Church.</p>

Secondly, for that ſince onely the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature can haue ſinne before the infuſion of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, the fruit conceiued is not obnoxious to ſinne. And therefore by what meanes ſoeuer the bleſſed Virgine was ſanctified, before giuing ſoule or life, ſhee ſhould neuer haue incurred the blot of originall ſinne: and ſo ſhee ſhould not haue ſtood in neede of redemption or ſaluation, which is by Chriſ, of whom it is ſaid,</hi> Matth. 1. <hi>He ſhall ſaue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſinnes. But this is inconuenient, that Chriſt ſhould not be the Sauior of all men, as wee reale in the firſt to Timothie, the fourth: Therefore it reſteth, that the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the bleſſed virgine was after ſhee receiued ſoule or life.</hi> Here then it is apparant, that this their Angelicall Doctor held the virgine <hi>Marie</hi> to be obnoxious to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, becauſe the ſanctification he ſpeakes of (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth) is a cleanſing from originall ſinne; as alſo for that he ſheweth, that it would haue beene inconuenient for her not to haue incurred the blot of originall ſinne, becauſe then ſhee ſhould not haue ſtood in neede of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. So that I thinke it is hereby plaine by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> vnderſtanding, that the

                     <hi>William</hi> the Duke of Normandie,<note place="margin">An apparition whereupon this doctrine was grounded, and the Feaſt of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception firſt inſtituted.</note> a man fearing God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had conquered England, and reformed the Church in the ſame Kingdome, was aduertiſed, that the Dacians made preparations for the warres againſt him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſent the Abbot <hi>Herſinus</hi> vnto them, to know the truth of their deſignements. The Abbot then being vpon his returne at ſea, was ſurpriſed with ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſtorme, that he and all his people were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their liues, if they had not ſought for ſuccour of the virgine <hi>Marie:</hi> for as they inuoked her with all the deuotion they could, behold there came from Heauen a venerable Perſonage, apparrelled like a Biſhop; who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſaluted the Abbot, ſaid vnto him, Will you be deliuered from this danger? he anſwered, that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more. Know you then (ſaid the Perſonage) that I am ſent from the virgine <hi>Marie</hi> to aduertiſe you, that you ſhall be deliuered from all danger, if you will obey me. Commaund (ſaid the Abbot) all that you pleaſe, and you ſhall be willingly obeyed.

The abbot asking vpon what day it ſhould bee kept, and what Seruice the Church ſhould ſay thereon, he anſwered, it ſhould be kept the eight of December, and for the Seruice they ſhould take that of the Natiuitie, putting the word Conception in lieu of Natiuitie.<note place="margin">Anno <hi>1060.</hi>
                     </note> Then the Perſonage vaniſhed away, the ſtorme ceaſed, and the Abbot eſcaped with all his companie, and afterward performed his promiſe.</q> Is not this a ſtrong foundation to build an article of Faith vpon? Let the circumſtances be conſidered; as that the Biſhop that appeared comming from the virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> vſed ſuch great familiaritie with the Abbot, as to ſalute him; that he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:25258:112"/>in a ſtorme, when wicked ſpirits are buſieſt; that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to keepe a Feaſt of that act concerning the bleſſed Virgine, which cannot be freed from ſinne; and iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not time to flye to the Scriptures reuealed from God, when ſuch viſions muſt ſerue (as it is probably deuiſed by the diuell, to delude men withall) for the eſtabliſhment of a new article of faith, as diuers of the Romane Church hold this to be. It may be this viſion might be ſuch a one, as I haue ſometimes heard of the like nature, by a certaine <q>Gentleman, as acquaintance of mine; who told mee, that one appeared vnto him in the forme of a Biſhop, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him he muſt be a Romane Catholike, if he would be ſaued, and that he ſhould trauell ouer the ſeas, eſcape many dangers, acquainting him with future euents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Earle of Eſſex and himſelfe, which he would not ſpeake of. Which viſion ſome of his kindred gaue credit vnto, and furthered him in his iourney. And I haue heard ſince, when his money was ſpent beyond the ſeas, he returned home againe, and finding himſelfe deluded by his viſion, embraced againe his former reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and continueth in it to this day.</q> Some Romaniſts haue thought that this viſion was but an inuention, that thereby hee might finde a few golden peeces out of his friends, the better to maintaine his trauailes. The truth of his viſion I leaue to his owne conſcience; but this I may truely ſay, there is a great reſemblance betwixt his and the Abbots: and therefore, in my iudgement, if the Diuell played the Biſhop in the one, he might as well doe it in the other.</p>

                  <q>conception, without originall ſinne. In the time of <hi>Charles,</hi> King of Fraunce, a certaine young man, nephew to the King of Hungarie, loued ſo much the Virgine <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and was ſo addicted to her ſeruice, that daily before he

Forthwith the chamber was repleniſhed with a great light, and he was reſtored to his health. Soone after his vncle died without iſſue, which made the Lords of the Countrey to perſuade him to enter into the eſtate of Marriage, to the end the Kingdome may not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heires, offering him a faire Ladie, which he married. But after he had receiued the bleſſing, he remembred, that he had not yet that day read our Ladies office, he retyred himſelfe to ſay them the more deuoutly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ladie Bride, with the reſt of the companie, home to his houſe; and when he ſaid that Anthieme, <hi>Pulchra es &amp; decora filia Hieruſalem;</hi> that is to ſay, Thou art faire and gracious, O daughter of Ieruſalem; ſuddainely the virgine <hi>Marie</hi> appeared vnto him, with two Angels attending her, and ſaid vnto him; If I am faire, honeſt, and gracious, as thou ſayeſt, wherefore doeſt thou forſake mee for another? am not I more beautifull than ſhe?

                  <note place="margin">Collections vpon this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> Iudge now (gentle Reader) whether this be an apparition likely to come from Heauen, when that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:25258:113"/>which is commaunded here, is ſo expreſſely againſt the word of God, inuiting from that ſtate of marriage which the Apoſtle calleth honourable, vnto the ſeruice of that fained, and deuiſed priuiledge of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Conception without originall ſinne, which I haue already ſhewed to be expreſly repugnant to the word of God, and therefore dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrally againſt faith. Beſides, the inſtitution it ſelfe is ſo late, that it appeareth to bee cockle ſowed by the enuious man the Deuill, not by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, and therefore not to be receiued by thoſe who know Antiquitie to bee the infallible marke of truth. The due obſeruation of all which premiſes conſidered in this Chapter, was as forcible an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to leade my feete out of the dangerous waies of Romiſh nouelties, as any other; therefore (curteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) let me intreate thee with me to call the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> moſt bleſſed amongſt women, as truly ſhee was vpon earth, and is ſo alſo in heauen in the glorie of her ſoule, but thinke her not yet ſo bleſſed, as in this point of her Conception to paralell her with Chriſt, and to attribute more vnto her then will ſtand with the nature of a pure Creature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from her that moſt bleſſed benefit of her Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt.

This I could exemplifie by the abuſes come into the Church by this reſtraint, both in former ages, and in this preſent age wherein wee liue. If this law had not been, it is likely that <hi>Matthaeus Pariſienſis</hi> would haue had no cauſe to leaue recorded vnto poſteritie, that a Cardinall did all the day
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:25258:121"/>in a Synode heere in England inueigh againſt the marriages of Prieſts,<note place="margin">Matth.

If this law of the Pope had not reſtrained Prieſts from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, occaſion would neuer haue been giuen for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in Wales this laſt yeare to haue written vnto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Birkhead</hi> the Arch-prieſt, complaining of a Ieſuite, who by the heate of the powder-treaſon was thought to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into Ireland, where he got his owne kinſwoman with child; neither would many the like abuſes bee complained of in diuers, if the wicked reſtraint of marriages, which is in truth the very doctrine of Diuels, had neuer been made and inuented? Gentle Reader pardon mee if theſe obſcaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties offend your eares, I may as well relate truthes in iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of true doctrine againſt the Church of Rome; as that Church both by reports and printed bookes may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge multitudes of lies againſt the reformed Church of England, your deare countrey. I do not this of any delight I take to walke in the wayes of ſinners, bt onely to diſcouer the wickedneſſe of their doctrine by ſuch their wicked fruits: as iuſt puniſhments inflicted by Gods permiſſion that they may ſee their errors, and forſake their wicked wayes. Now therefore ſince it appeared vnto me by theſe premiſes, how the Church of Rome againſt the law of God, againſt the practiſe of the pureſt ages, to the ſcandall of the Chriſtian world, through Satans craft vnder pretence of chaſtitie reſtrained Prieſts from lawfull marriages, I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the communion of that Church, leſt by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in time I might alſo be partaker of her iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And as I was moued to aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don her by reaſon of this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whereby the diuel maketh her his;<note place="margin">The Church of Rome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> ſo was I no leſſe moued by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of her doctrine permitting ſuch mariages to be lawful in ſuch degrees, as ſom of their own teach to be prohibited by the law of God &amp; nature; as namely, by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one brother to marrie his brothers wife, when the other
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:25258:121"/>is deceaſed. For ſo doth the Pope by diſpencing in this caſe, which notwithſtanding is iuſtly to be reprooued, as I proue out of <hi>Ioannes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iguerius</hi> the learned Biſhop of Spaine, who <q>deliuereth his Doctrine thus; It is a doubt,<note place="margin">Io. Viguer.

It ſeemeth that hee can not, becauſe the Pope cannot diſpence in the Law of Nature. But the firſt aforeſaide degree of Affinitie is prohibited by the Law of Nature: (Thou ſhalt not reueale the turpitude of thy Brothers wife, becauſe it is thy turpitude) for that as <hi>Rabbi Moyſes</hi> ſaith, the Lawe giuen in that place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth onely thoſe perſons from marriage, who are to conuerſe and dwell together, amongſt whom the one is to keep the others pudicicitie: and ſo only he excepteth them, which by the law of nature are excepted from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, ſince the text brings a naturall reaſon, ſaying; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the turpitude of thy brother: And the refore herein the Lawe is not figurall, but morall; and no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation can be made of morall precepts. And of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſeemed to bee, for hee ſaieth,<note place="margin">In. <hi>4</hi> diſt. <hi>39.</hi> q. <hi>1</hi> art. <hi>3.</hi> ad tertium</note> that that Law doth yet continue, becauſe if Infidells (and he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of Iewes, but abſolutely of all Infidells) before they are conuerted haue contracted matrimony againſt that law, after faith receiued, they cannot continue in ſuch matrimony. Therefore this Law is morall, and not iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. And although from the beginning of mankind, when the Author of nature diſpenced, for the fewneſſe of men, to contract marriages in the ſame degree; yet not after multiplication, becauſe the diſpenſation and inclination of contracting, ceaſed not only in conſanguinitie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Affinitie. And although God haue diſpenſed with the Iewes, yea alſo cammanded a brother to take his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife, to raiſe his brothers ſeede, that his brother might haue children, that his name might not bee blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     </note> for it is ſaid, Hee that ſhall marry the wife of his brother, ſhall do an vnlawfull thing. Since therefore that of rayſing the brothers ſeed was a iudiciall Lawe, and all the iudiciall Lawes were finiſhed in the death of Chriſt, and God diſpenceth not in them; it followeth, that neyther the Pope can diſpence with it, becauſe it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and naturall; neyther is it alike in a Vowe and an Oath with the aforeſaid degree of Affinitie or Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie, becauſe although Chriſt gaue power ouer all contracts and conſents of men, to annull them or change them:</q>

In the ſerious ſpeculation of which great fauour from heauen I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to call to remembraunce that ſtraunge thing which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> and ninth chapter, <hi>vt refert Cornel.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:25258:123"/>was a chaine of his prouidence by miniſtring occaſions of times, perſons, and places, concurring to my conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: It is a chaine of truth that euery mans chiefe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this life muſt bee to attaine vnto the end he is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto by God, or elſe hee receiueth his ſoule in vaine: It is a chaine reaching from heauen, that a ſupernaturall and reuealed knowledge from God is neceſſarie to ſaluation. The obſeruation alſo of an abſolute neceſſitie of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Faith, is a ſtrong chaine to draw any man to ſearch diligently after it. The knowledge likewiſe of the right rule and golden mete-wand of true Faith, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of GODS ſacred Word, is a moſt forcible chaine to drawe Chriſtians vnto the right knowledge of GODS truth. The true knowne viſible Church of Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true ſenſe of Scriptures, is a powerfull chaine to draw men vnto the right faith of CHRIST IESVS. Conformitie of Doctrine with the ancient doctrine of the Primitiue Church, being a proper marke of the true Church of God, is likewiſe a moſt attractiue chaine draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true knowledge of right Chriſtianitie. The wonders and ſuppoſed miracles which Chriſt fore-told the Pſeudo-Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, ſhould doe for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Gods Elect, if it were poſſible, are alſo a ſtrong chaine to draw any man from the Church of Rome. The great hypocriſie of falſe Teachers fore-ſpoken of in the holy Scriptures, agreeing chiefly with the Church of Rome, are a chaine of great ſtrength and power to draw any man from that Church. The fruits by which falſe Prophets are to bee knowne, and diſcerned, abounding in the Church of Rome, are alſo a powerfull chaine to draw any man of true iudgement from the abhominiations of that Church. The diſcouerie of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe to bee Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, which is accompted by the Church of Rome the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt act of religion that can bee done to God, is a moſt forcible chaine to draw any man to the knowledge of CHRIST IESVS, once offered for vs, procuring our

Is not the Amputation alſo of the holy Euchariſt a powerfull chaine to draw men from the Church of Rome, that they may rightly, according to Chriſts inſtitution, bee partakers of the Lords Supper elſe where? Is not alſo the noueltie of the Popes Pardons and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, which is annexed to Croſſes, Graines, and Meddals, a powerfull chaine to draw any man that is not ridiculouſly childiſh, a ſtronge chaine to draw him from the Church of Rome? If the falſe doctrine of ſeuen Sacraments be well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered by any man, bee can not want a ſtrong chaine to draw him to acknowledgement of two true Sacraments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt: if the doctrine of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in originall ſinne bee doubtfull in the Church of Rome, the truth of Scriptures ſhewing it certaine may ſerue for a ſtrong chaine to draw any man from that doubtfulneſſe: If the pretended chaſtitie of the Romiſh Clergie, doe make the Church of Rome ſeeme more pure and holy than any other; the prohibition of lawfull marriage to Prieſts, and the diſpenſation and permiſſion of vnlawfull marriage to kindred, may bee as a ſtrong chaine to draw deceiued ſoules from the filth and impurities of her hypocriticall holineſſe.

Be not (I beſeech you) ouer-credulous in eaſily beleeuing euery thing that vnaduiſedly your Teachers ſhall ſuggeſt vnto you, but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Doctrines, according to the rule Doctor <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> preſcribeth vnto you, ſpoken of in my eleuenth chapter, num. 3.4.5. that is, by conſidering the fruits of your Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and whether the doctrine they teach you be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the doctrine of former times, generally receiued and taught in the Primitiue Church: beleeue not all they ſay of the Preachers of the Church of England, whom they often moſt notoriouſly traduce with moſt falſe calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as namely, I heard an auncient Prieſt in the Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Louaine, ſome few yeares ſince, report of the death of Biſhop <hi>Iuell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Iuell</hi> calumniated.</note> affirming, that he trauelling here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was taken with a ſuddaine ſickneſſe, and ſo compelled to light in a houſe where Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> had vſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to lodge in, and growing worſe and worſe, hee was forced to betake himſelfe to a bed, where his paines encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, by the iuſt iudgement of God, becauſe Maſter Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> had often layen there before, he grew into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fits, crying out, Doctor <hi>Harding,</hi> Doctor <hi>Harding,</hi> and wiſhing he had neuer ſet penne to paper againſt him,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:25258:126"/>and ſo died as a man in deſpaire in Doctor <hi>Hardings</hi> bed. This was told as a remarkable matter againſt him, for the reproofe of his doctrine, and magnifying of Maſter <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi> which I am informed by credible men to be moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true and falſe. Therefore I ſay vnto you againe (deere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) be not ouer-credulous, but beware of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who haue their conſciences ſo ſeared, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not how falſely they ſpeake, ſo they may any way tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the credit and reputation of their aduerſaries amongſt you, charging both <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> and other true Conuertites of Ieſus, with ſuch things as are not to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, moſt iniuriouſly; but no maruell, when otherwiſe they cannot defend their cauſe. Againe, let me obtaine ſo much of you, as to bee frequent in reading the Word of God, which although it haue many difficult things in it, yet for ſo much as belongs to faith and manners, neceſſarie for euery man to know, it is eaſie and facile. If you will haue an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, by which you may know the Shepheards, which like good ſheepe you ought to follow remember that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>In hoc cognoſcent quod diſcipuli mei ſitis ſi charitatem habueritis ad inuicem.</hi> In this men ſhall knowe that you are my Diſciples, if you haue charitie one towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now whether you finde this mutuall charitie amongſt your or our Clergie, either in doctrine or manners, I leaue to your owne iudgements to conſider. And as for my ſelfe, ſuch as haue beene acquainted with me, if they will ſay truly, I am ſure that my conuerſation amongſt them hath alwaies, ſince my Prieſthood, beene ſuch, as cannot bee toucht with any kind of diſorder; my zeale in the blindneſſe of that faith as forward as others, to the ſmall portion of Talent which God hath beſtowed vpon me, making me as readie by day and by night to draw men to the Romiſh faith, as any mans, either by preaching, or other labours, with as great ſinceritie as poſſibly might be. No man can charge me of mercenarie couetouſneſſe, for making a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopole of any of you for mine owne profit, or the wrong
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:25258:126"/>of others, hauing alwaies beene as readie to giue as to take, carrying in minde that of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianum.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignominia eſt omnium ſacerdotum proprijs ſtudere diuitiis,</hi> It is a reproach of all Prieſts to ſtudie to enrich themſelues. Therefore I haue neuer repined, that others ſhould gaine the profit of my paines, or gather the fruit of my labours. Had I beene of ſuch an auaricious diſpoſition (as is too frequent amongſt many) I could haue prouided ſufficient meanes to haue ſupplied my preſent wants, in the caſe I now ſtand in, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I may truly ſay, <hi>Amici mei &amp; proximi mei aduerſum me approprinquanerunt &amp; ſteterunt,</hi> My louers and friends haue approached againſt mee, and haue ſtood aloofe from mee. Therefore ſince my carriage amongſt you, euen in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that Church, was ſuch, as might beſeeme the dutie of a good Shepheard, let this moue you to thinke, that God hath bleſſed my ſinceritie ſo much, as to accept it in his ſight for the greater benefit of my conuerſion, vnleſſe you ſee a change and alteration in my life and conuerſation, as I thanke God I feele none my ſelfe, but rather an abettre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the religion I am come vnto; eſteeme it the worke of God, and make your benefit of it, for your owne ſoules good, through Gods mercie, who draweth vnto him as much by example as by any other meanes. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you conſider well theſe my obſeruations, and turne to the true Catholike faith, whereof you are ignorant, but in name and pretended claime.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:25258:127"/>and inuentions of men; you haue the diuine Seruice towards God in your owne Tongues, to your comforts, and not in vnknowne Languages; you are deliuered by Gods grace from the flauiſh bondage of the Popes gouernment, and are bleſſed vnder the ſweete and milde regiment of a gracious Prince, who purchaſeth by his ſweete mercifull diſpoſition your loues, and procureth vnto you peace and happineſſe, free from ciuile warres and mutuall contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Be not (I ſay) vngratefull for ſuch ineſtimable bleſſings, leaſt ingratitude to God ſhould ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely depriue you of them, and beſtow them vpon others that will ſhew themſelues more thankfull for them: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is the onely bane of Chriſtians, which ſoone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaueth men of all Gods fauors, and therefore rightly <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> calleth it,<note place="margin">Bernard. ſuper Cantic.</note>

Theſe wordes of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> are fit for vs, who exhorteth the Galathians to the workes of holineſſe, the true effects of a iuſtifying faith: Wherein the Apoſtle performeth the part of a prudent and wiſe Husbandman, who to keepe his workemen and labourers from ſlouth, and to encourage them to goe ſtoutly forward in their paines without fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, putteth them in minde of the fruitfull harueſt that will follow, that ſtrengthened with the ioyfull hope of gaine, they may willingly continue in the toyle of their worke. For ſo Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> knowing all Chriſtians to be labourers and workemen in the field of Gods Church, and that it is as proper for them all to doe the workes of vertue and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, as it is for the birdes to flye; to the end they may not be tyred out with the heate and burden of the day, nor be wearied with the toyle of tribulations and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of any temptations, and ſo giue ouer good workes, but perſeuere to the end and period of their liues, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth vnto them the great fruit that ſhall bee reaped at Harueſt, after all their vertuous deedes, and all ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in any perſecutions; when for their teares they ſhall reape ioy; when for earthly wants they ſhall enioy ſtore of heauenly treaſures; when for all the valiant combats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the world, the fleſh, and the diuell, in the conſtant confeſsion of their faith before God and man, Heauen ſhall be their reward, and glorie their crowne.
